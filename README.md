#Javelin-UI

## Bootstrap inspired UI elements for Javelin

This code base is a work in progress. I would say, fork it!

#Whats Important Here

The only thing worth looking at is the plugins folder. It
has a bunch of plugins designed to work on top of Javelin.

If you download the repo and run it locally using MAMP, XAMPP
the root index.html page is the documentation page for all
plugins.

Alternatively, each plugin directory has a documentation .html page
in it.
