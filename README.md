#Javelin-UI

## Bootstrap inspired UI elements for Javelin

This code base is a work in progress. I would say, fork it!

#Whats Important Here

The only thing worth looking at is the plugins folder. It
has a bunch of plugins designed to work on top of Javelin.

I am in the process of cleaning up the repo and setting up proper Github pages.
Till then, each plugin folder has a .html file showcasing how to use the plugin.
